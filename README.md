# 🐹 Learn Go

Welcome to my Go (Golang) learning journey! 🚀  
This repository contains small projects, examples, and practice code as I explore the Go programming language.

## 📌 Goals
- Understand Go syntax and basics
- Practice writing clean, idiomatic Go code
- Build mini projects and experiments

## 🛠️ How to Run
Make sure you have [Go installed](https://go.dev/dl/).  
Then run:

```bash
go run filename.go
